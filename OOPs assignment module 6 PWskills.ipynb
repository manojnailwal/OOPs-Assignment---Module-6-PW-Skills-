For example, a \"Car\" class could have attributes like color, model, and speed.\\n\\n2. Object: An object is an instance of a class. It’s a specific example that follows the blueprint of the class. So, if \"Car\" is a class, then a \"red Ferrari\" could be an object created from it. Each object can have different values for the class\\'s attributes.\\n\\n3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together in a single unit or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the class’s details, usually using access modifiers (like private or public). This protects data and keeps the internal workings of an object hidden from the outside world, allowing only specific interactions.\\n\\n4. Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This helps in reusing code and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes. For example, if there’s a class called \"Vehicle,\" a \"Car\" class can inherit from it, gaining its attributes and methods, and adding more specific features unique to cars.\\n\\n5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class even if they behave differently.
